### Problem Definition 

Farmers do not get profits for their products as they sell those products to the middleman and middleman in order to get benefits. They sell these products at a much higher rate and as farmers are not aware of the market prices they get tricked by the middleman . Also a lot of farmers production gets wasted due to improper maintenance for food storage .  Due to all the difficulties faced by the farmers in spite of working hard farmers tend to commit sucide as they do have to earn enough to provide basic necessities to their families .

### The objectives of this Project are as follows :
* To develop a system that can provide benefits to the farmers.
* To provide a base for the farmers where they can decide the price for their products .
* To sell products in bulk in order to prevent the wastage of food .
* To provide an auction system so that the farmers can get maximum profits.
* To provide a base where the farmers as well as customers can ask any queries.
